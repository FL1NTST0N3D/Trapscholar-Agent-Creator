---

## Page Types

### Lead Capture

**Goal:** Collect contact information in exchange for a resource (ebook, whitepaper, webinar recording, template).

**Structure:** Headline → value proposition → resource preview → form → social proof → FAQ
**Form fields:** Name, email, company (optional), role (optional)
**Conversion benchmark:** 15-30% for gated content

### Product Launch

**Goal:** Generate excitement and early adopters for a new product or feature.

**Structure:** Hero with launch messaging → demo video/screenshots → feature highlights → early access CTA → waitlist form
**Key element:** Countdown timer or "launching on [date]" urgency
**Conversion benchmark:** 10-25% for waitlist signups

### Webinar Registration

**Goal:** Drive registrations for a live or on-demand webinar.

**Structure:** Headline with topic + date → speaker bios → agenda/what you'll learn → registration form → social proof
**Form fields:** Name, email, company, role
**Conversion benchmark:** 20-40% from targeted traffic

### Pricing

**Goal:** Convert comparison shoppers into paying customers.

**Structure:** Plan comparison table → feature breakdown → FAQ → testimonials → CTA per plan
**Key element:** Highlighted "most popular" plan, annual vs. monthly toggle
**Conversion benchmark:** 5-15% (higher-intent traffic)

### Comparison

**Goal:** Win competitive evaluations by positioning against alternatives.

**Structure:** Hero with comparison headline → feature-by-feature comparison table → differentiators → customer switching stories → CTA
**Key element:** Fair, factual comparison (avoid appearing deceptive)
**Conversion benchmark:** 8-20% from comparison-intent traffic

### Waitlist

**Goal:** Build pre-launch demand and collect early interest.

**Structure:** Hero with coming soon → product teaser → email capture → referral program → social proof of interest
**Form fields:** Email only (minimize friction)
**Conversion benchmark:** 25-45% for compelling products

### Free Tool

**Goal:** Provide immediate value through a free tool (calculator, grader, generator) and capture leads.

**Structure:** Tool interface above fold → results with upgrade CTA → methodology explanation → related content
**Key element:** Value delivered before asking for anything
**Conversion benchmark:** 20-40% for tool usage, 5-15% for lead capture after results

---

## Layout Patterns

### Standard Conversion Layout

```
1. Hero (above fold)
   - Headline + subheadline
   - Primary CTA
   - Hero image/video

2. Social Proof Bar
   - Logo strip or stat bar
   - "Trusted by 10,000+ teams"

3. Benefits Section
   - 3-4 benefits with icons
   - Short descriptions

4. Features Section
   - Detailed feature cards
   - Screenshots or illustrations

5. Testimonials
   - 2-3 customer quotes
   - Photos, names, titles, companies

6. FAQ
   - 5-7 common questions
   - Accordion format

7. Final CTA
   - Repeat primary CTA
   - Risk reducer ("No credit card required")
```

### Long-Form Sales Page

```
1. Problem statement (agitate the pain)
2. Solution introduction
3. Credibility (logos, press, stats)
4. Feature walkthrough (with screenshots)
5. Benefit-oriented copy blocks
6. Case studies / success stories
7. Pricing / offer
8. FAQ / objection handling
9. Final CTA with guarantee
```

## Copy Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitation-Solution)

**Structure:**
1. **Problem:** Identify the specific pain point
2. **Agitation:** Amplify the consequences of not solving it
3. **Solution:** Present your product as the answer

**Example:**
> **Problem:** Your sales team spends 60% of their time on manual data entry instead of selling.
>
> **Agitation:** Every hour wasted on admin work is revenue left on the table. At scale, that's hundreds of thousands in lost deals per quarter, and your best reps burn out.
>
> **Solution:** Intempt automates the busywork so your team focuses on what they do best: closing deals. Customers see 3x pipeline velocity in the first 90 days.

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**Structure:**
1. **Attention:** Bold headline that stops the scroll
2. **Interest:** Expand with relevant details
3. **Desire:** Build emotional connection with benefits and proof
4. **Action:** Clear, compelling CTA

**Example:**
> **Attention:** "Stop guessing which leads will convert."
>
> **Interest:** Our AI scoring model analyzes 50+ behavioral signals to rank every lead in real time.
>
> **Desire:** Teams using Intempt close 40% more deals with 25% less effort. See how Acme Corp grew revenue 2.3x in one quarter.
>
> **Action:** [Start Free Trial, No Credit Card Required]

### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

**Structure:**
1. **Before:** Describe the current painful state
2. **After:** Paint the picture of the desired outcome
3. **Bridge:** Show how your product connects the two

**Example:**
> **Before:** Campaigns take weeks to build. Results trickle in. You cannot prove ROI to the board.
>
> **After:** Imagine launching campaigns in hours, watching conversions in real time, and walking into board meetings with a revenue attribution dashboard.
>
> **Bridge:** Intempt gives you the complete engagement platform to get from chaos to clarity. Here's how.

## Hero Section

### Headline

- **Length:** 6-12 words
- **Structure:** [Benefit/outcome] + [for whom] or [Action verb] + [specific result]
- **Font size:** 36-48px (desktop), 28-36px (mobile)
- **Alignment:** Left-aligned (outperforms centered for English readers)

**Strong headline patterns:**
| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Outcome-focused | "Turn website visitors into paying customers" |
| Quantified | "Close 40% more deals in 90 days" |
| Audience-specific | "The engagement platform built for B2B SaaS" |
| Challenger | "Stop wasting money on campaigns that don't convert" |

### Subheadline

- **Length:** 15-25 words
- **Purpose:** Explain how the headline outcome is achieved
- **Font size:** 18-24px (desktop), 16-20px (mobile)
- **Tone:** Slightly more detailed and specific than the headline

### CTA Button

- **Text:** 2-5 words, action-oriented, first person works well ("Start My Free Trial")
- **Color:** High contrast against background. Avoid grey, light blue, or muted tones.
- **Size:** Minimum 44px height (tap target), 160-280px width
- **Microcopy below button:** Risk reducer ("No credit card required", "Free 14-day trial", "Cancel anytime")

### Hero Image/Video

- **Image:** Product screenshot, lifestyle photo, or illustration showing the outcome
- **Video:** 60-90 second product overview. Autoplay muted with captions. Play button overlay.
- **Placement:** Right of headline (desktop) or below (mobile)
- **Do not use:** Generic stock photos, abstract shapes without meaning, competitor-style visuals

## Social Proof Types

| Type | Format | Best For | Example |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logo strip | 4-8 customer logos in a row | Establishing credibility | "Trusted by teams at [logos]" |
| Stats bar | 3-4 key metrics | Quantifying traction | "10,000+ teams | 50M events/day | 99.9% uptime" |
| Testimonial quotes | Quote + photo + name/title | Building trust | "Intempt doubled our conversion rate in 60 days.", Sarah Chen, VP Marketing, Acme |
| Star ratings | Star icons + count | Consumer products | "4.8/5 from 2,400+ reviews on G2" |
| Case study snippets | Mini case study (2-3 sentences + stat) | Complex B2B | "How Acme increased pipeline velocity by 3x" |
| Media mentions | "As seen in" + publication logos | Credibility | "Featured in TechCrunch, Forbes, Product Hunt" |
| User count | Total users/customers number | Bandwagon effect | "Join 10,000+ growth teams" |

---

## CTA Hierarchy

### Primary CTA (Above the Fold)

- **Position:** In the hero section, immediately visible
- **Goal:** Capture high-intent visitors immediately
- **Style:** Largest button, highest contrast, action-oriented text
- **Example:** "Start Free Trial" / "Get Started Free" / "Book a Demo"

### Secondary CTA (After Benefits)

- **Position:** After the benefits/features section
- **Goal:** Convert visitors who needed more information before committing
- **Style:** Same design as primary, possibly with slightly different text
- **Example:** "See It in Action" / "Try It Free" / "Watch Demo"

### Final CTA (Bottom of Page)

- **Position:** Last section before the footer
- **Goal:** Last chance conversion for visitors who read the entire page
- **Style:** Full-width section with headline + CTA + risk reducer
- **Example headline:** "Ready to [achieve the outcome]?"
- **Include:** Repeat risk reducers (no credit card, free trial, cancel anytime)

## Form Optimization

### Field Count Impact on Conversion

| Fields | Relative Conversion | Use Case |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 (email only) | Baseline (highest) | Newsletter, waitlist, content download |
| 2 (name + email) | ~85% of baseline | Lead magnet, free trial |
| 3 (name + email + company) | ~70% of baseline | B2B lead gen, webinar |
| 4+ fields | ~55% of baseline | Qualified demo request, enterprise contact |

### Progressive Profiling

Collect additional information over time rather than in a single form:
1. **First touch:** Email only
2. **Second interaction:** First name + company
3. **Third interaction:** Role + team size
4. **Demo request:** Full qualification (phone, budget, timeline)

### Form Best Practices

- Use placeholder text AND labels (placeholders alone disappear on focus)
- Single-column forms outperform multi-column
- Button text should match the value exchange ("Get the Guide" not "Submit")
- Show field-level validation inline, not after submission
- Auto-detect country/timezone from IP for pre-fill
- Add a privacy note near the button: "We respect your privacy. Unsubscribe anytime."

---

## Mobile-First Constraints

| Constraint | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Layout | Single column only. No side-by-side content. |
| CTA buttons | Minimum 44px height (Apple HIG touch target). Full-width on mobile. |
| Font sizes | Body: minimum 16px (prevents iOS zoom). Headlines: 24-32px. |
| Images | Responsive (`max-width: 100%; height: auto;`). Lazy-loaded below fold. |
| Horizontal scroll | Absolutely none. Test at 320px width. |
| Form inputs | Minimum 44px height. Appropriate keyboard types (`type="email"`, `type="tel"`). |
| Navigation | Hamburger menu or hidden. Do not show full nav on landing pages. |
| Spacing | Generous padding (16-24px sides). Thumb-friendly tap targets. |
| Video | Inline, muted autoplay. Provide poster image. Avoid autoplay sound. |

## Landing Page Conversion Benchmarks: Directional Ranges

Treat every figure below as directional, not guaranteed. No single authoritative benchmark exists across industries, traffic sources, and page types, and published conversion-rate reports frequently disagree with each other by a wide margin. Use these as sanity-check ranges when reviewing a page's performance, not as citable stats in customer-facing output.

### Conversion Rate Ranges by Page Type

| Page Type | Low | Median | Good | Top Tier |
|-----------|-----|--------|------|---------|
| SaaS free trial signup | 2-5% | 7-10% | 12-18% | 25%+ |
| Demo request (B2B SaaS) | 3-8% | 8-12% | 15-22% | 30%+ |
| Lead magnet (gated content) | 10-20% | 20-30% | 30-45% | 55%+ |
| Webinar registration | 15-25% | 25-40% | 40-55% | 65%+ |
| Ecommerce product page | 1.5-3% | 3-5% | 5-8% | 12%+ |
| Ecommerce checkout initiation | 45-55% | 55-65% | 65-75% | 80%+ |
| Paid ad landing page (general) | 2-5% | 5-8% | 8-15% | 20%+ |

**Important context:** These ranges are for all traffic blended together. High-intent, pre-qualified traffic (retargeting, high-score MQLs, branded search) typically converts several times higher than cold traffic.

### Factors That Tend to Move Landing Page CVR

Directional patterns observed repeatedly in conversion optimization practice. Actual lift varies by product, audience, and starting point, so do not quote these as fixed percentages to customers.

| Factor | Typical Direction of Impact |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Removing navigation menu | Often improves conversion meaningfully by removing exit paths |
| Personalized headline (vs. generic) | Modest but consistent improvement |
| Video in hero section | Can help or hurt depending on product complexity and autoplay behavior; test rather than assume |
| First-person CTA text ("Start MY trial") | Small improvement for individual-user products; less consistent for team products |
| Social proof near CTA | Meaningful improvement, especially for cold traffic |
| Reducing form field count | Fewer fields consistently improves completion rate, with diminishing returns per field removed |
| Adding "no credit card" microcopy | Small but consistent improvement on SaaS trial pages |
| Page load time improvements | Faster pages convert better; the relationship is well established even without a fixed per-second figure |
| Mobile optimization | Meaningful improvement specifically for mobile traffic |

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Time to First Byte (TTFB) | < 200ms | WebPageTest |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) | < 2.5s | Lighthouse |
| Interaction to Next Paint (INP) | ≤ 200ms | Lighthouse |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) | < 0.1 | Lighthouse |
| Total page weight | < 1MB | WebPageTest |
| Initial CSS/JS | < 100KB combined | Bundle analyzer |
| Hero image | < 150KB (compressed, WebP) | Squoosh |
| Time to Interactive | < 3s on 4G | Lighthouse |
| Number of HTTP requests | < 30 | DevTools Network |

### Image Optimization

- Use WebP format with JPEG fallback
- Serve responsive images with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
- Lazy-load all images below the fold (`loading="lazy"`)
- Compress to 80% quality (visually lossless)
- Use CDN with edge caching

## Conversion Copy Patterns: Directional Guidance

The patterns below are common findings from conversion optimization practice generally. Treat every direction and range as directional, not guaranteed. No single authoritative study backs these numbers, actual results vary enormously by audience, product, and traffic source, and the only way to know what works for a given page is to test it. Do not present any of the ranges below to a customer as a documented, sourced study.

---

### Headlines: Outcome vs. Feature Framing

Across conversion optimization practice, outcome-led headlines (what the visitor gets) tend to outperform feature-led or category-led headlines (what the product is) for cold and unaware traffic. Specificity also tends to beat vagueness: a concrete promise generally beats a generic call to action.

**Exception:** when the feature is a genuine differentiator and the audience is already problem-aware, a feature-forward headline can win, because the audience already knows what they need and the feature list functions as confirmation rather than education.

**Illustrative headline patterns (style examples, not sourced test data):**
| Headline Style | Example | What It Illustrates |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Jobs-to-be-done framing | "Say it with a video when a message just won't cut it" | Names the moment, not the product. |
| Hyper-specific outcome | "The issue tracker that makes you faster" | "Faster" reads more concrete than "better." |
| Audience-specific framing | "Analytics for Product Teams" | Naming the audience directly tends to help on cold, self-selecting traffic. |

**"Who it's for + what it does" structure tends to help when:**
- Traffic is high-intent and self-selecting (paid search, branded search)
- The audience feels generic tools ignore their specific use case
- The category is competitive enough that the audience qualifier becomes the differentiator

---

### Social Proof: Placement and Format

**Placement patterns:**
- Moving social proof from the bottom of the page to directly below the hero CTA tends to improve conversion for cold traffic, since visitors have not yet built trust and need reassurance close to the decision point.
- Warm traffic (retargeting, email lists) tends to respond better to social proof placed mid-page or near a secondary CTA, since trust is already partly established and the remaining work is objection handling.
- Testimonials placed below the fold generally get meaningfully less attention than testimonials placed near the primary CTA, where visual weight matches the decision point.

**Logo strips vs. testimonials vs. star ratings:**
- Logo strips alone tend to produce a small lift, and only when the logos are immediately recognizable. Unrecognized logos add little.
- Testimonials tend to produce a larger lift than logo strips on their own, but vague testimonials ("great tool, love it") can hurt conversion relative to no testimonial at all, since generic praise can read as inauthentic.
- Star ratings paired with a visible review count tend to outperform star ratings shown alone; a rating with no count attached carries much less weight.

**Testimonial format:**
- A full quote with a photo, name, title, and company tends to read as most credible. Name and company are close to a minimum bar; anything less can read as fabricated.
- Short pull quotes tend to work best above the fold or near a CTA; longer, more detailed quotes tend to work better in a dedicated testimonial section further down the page.
- Video testimonials can meaningfully outperform text, but results vary widely by format: short, specific story-format clips tend to help, while long talking-head videos and autoplay hero video can distract from the primary CTA and hurt conversion.

**Customer count framing:**
- A bare number ("10,000+ teams") tends to produce a moderate, easily-dismissed lift on its own.
- Naming recognizable customers alone can feel like cherry-picking to skeptical cold traffic.
- Combining a specific count with recognizable customer names in one phrase tends to outperform either alone, since it pairs scale proof with quality proof.

---

### CTA Words: Directional Patterns

**First-person CTA phrasing** ("Start my free trial" vs. "Start your free trial") tends to outperform second-person phrasing for individual-user SaaS and consumer products, but can underperform for team products, where addressing an individual feels mismatched to a group purchase decision.

**Words that tend to underperform:**

| Word/Phrase | Why It Tends to Underperform |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| "Submit" | Frames the action as work for the visitor, not value received |
| "Click here" | Reads as low-effort, generic copy and can reduce perceived trust |
| "Learn more" | Weak for paid search traffic; implies the visitor is still just considering |
| "Register" | Reads as bureaucratic rather than valuable |

**Words that tend to outperform:**

| Word | Why | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| "Get" | Frontloads the value the visitor receives, not the action they take | "Get started", "Get my demo", "Get the guide" |
| "Start" | Implies momentum without implying heavy effort | Common on SaaS trial pages |
| "Try" | Reduces commitment, signals reversibility | Useful when risk perception is the main objection |
| "See" | Promises information, not commitment | "See how it works", "See a demo" |

**Microcopy that tends to reduce friction:**

| Microcopy | Typical Effect |
|-----------|-----------------|
| "No credit card required" below CTA | Tends to modestly increase trial starts; works best directly below the button, not separated from it |
| "Takes 2 minutes" / "Up in 60 seconds" | Reduces time-cost anxiety |
| "Cancel anytime" | Reduces the perceived risk of "getting trapped" on pricing pages |
| "Join 12,000+ marketers" (proof + CTA combined) | Works well for newsletters; combines belonging, proof, and relevance in one line |

**CTA button color:** there is no universally winning color. The consistent finding across conversion optimization practice is that contrast beats any specific color choice, since the highest-performing CTA is generally whichever one has the most visual contrast against its surrounding page.

---

### What Tends Not to Work

**Rotating carousels / sliders:** usability research consistently finds that only a small fraction of visitors click a rotating banner carousel at all, and of those, the large majority only ever engage with the first slide. Replacing a homepage carousel with a single static hero tends to improve conversion, sometimes substantially, though the exact size of the improvement varies widely by case.

**Stock photography:** genuine product screenshots and authentic photography (real founders, real product UI) tend to outperform generic stock photography. Obviously staged stock imagery can reduce trust in usability testing, even when it is aesthetically polished.

**Navigation bars on landing pages:** removing top navigation from a dedicated landing page tends to improve conversion, since navigation gives visitors an exit path that isn't the intended conversion action. Exception: pages built for informational search intent, where removing navigation can hurt session depth.

**Long pages vs. short pages:** short pages tend to win when the product is inexpensive, traffic is warm, and the offer is simple to understand. Long pages tend to win when the product is high-ticket or enterprise, traffic is cold, and there are multiple objections that need addressing before a visitor will convert.

---

### Form Optimization: Directional Patterns

Each additional form field tends to reduce completion rate, with the first field added after the minimum having the largest relative impact and each subsequent field having a smaller, diminishing impact (the visitors who remain are more committed).

**Multi-step forms** tend to outperform single long-page forms for form completion, especially for forms with many fields. The commonly cited mechanism is the Zeigarnik effect: once someone starts a multi-step flow, they feel a pull to finish it, which a single static page does not trigger in the same way. Reported lifts vary enormously across cases, so treat any single "X% to Y%" claim with skepticism unless you can verify it against your own data.

**"Email only first"** is a common pattern for reducing initial friction: collect only an email address at first contact, then use progressive profiling (showing returning visitors additional fields on later visits) rather than asking for everything up front.

---

### SaaS Pricing Page Patterns

**Common traits of pricing pages that convert well:**
- Concrete usage numbers ("unlimited projects," "100 GB storage") tend to outperform vague tier names
- Showing the annual discount as a monthly-equivalent price ("$15/month billed annually") tends to make the discount feel larger
- A "most popular" label on a middle tier tends to steer selection toward that tier
- An on-page FAQ addressing common objections tends to reduce the need for a sales conversation before conversion
- Honest, specific comparison tables tend to outperform vague "why not just use a competitor" framing

**Annual/monthly toggle:** defaulting to annual billing tends to increase annual plan selection, and prominently showing the percentage saved tends to reinforce that. Defaulting to annual can also introduce mild sticker shock that reduces total trial starts even as revenue per trial start increases, which is why many growth-stage SaaS companies default to monthly and optimize for total signups instead.

**Free plan conversion:** freemium-to-paid conversion in B2B SaaS is generally a low single-digit percentage. Free-plan users who do convert tend to have comparable long-term value to paid-trial converts, since they are typically more engaged by the time they decide to pay.
- Upgrade trigger is the key design decision: Slack's free plan hits a real message history limit (converts ~30% of free teams, 2019 figures). Notion's limits are generous enough that many small teams never upgrade.

## Conversion Benchmarks, and Why Industry Is the Wrong Comparison

Median landing-page conversion sits around **6.6%** across industries, with wide spread: SaaS and
technology nearer **3.8%**, financial services **8.4%**, events and entertainment **12.3%**. Strong
performers run **10-15%+**.

**But traffic source moves the number more than industry does.** Email traffic converts around
**19.3%**; organic search around **2.7%**. That is a 7x spread inside any single industry, which means
an industry benchmark quoted without the traffic mix is close to meaningless.

The practical consequence: **ask what traffic hits this page before judging its rate.** A 3%
conversion rate on cold organic search is unremarkable. The same 3% on warm email traffic is a broken
page. Two teams reporting identical rates can have opposite problems, and no amount of copy work fixes
the one that is actually a traffic-mix issue.

State the traffic source, the offer type, and what counts as a conversion on this page, next to any
rate. Without all three, the number is not comparable to anything, including its own past.

## Form Length Is the Highest-Leverage Variable

Form length has a larger, more reliable effect than almost anything else on the page:

| Fields | Typical conversion |
|---|---|
| 3 | ~10.1% |
| 9 | ~3.6% |

Removing a single field has been measured at up to a **50%** lift on its own. That makes the field
list the first thing to attack, before headline testing, before layout, before design.

For every field, ask: **is this used before the first human conversation?** Anything needed only later
in the process belongs later in the process. Job title, company size, and phone number are the usual
offenders, collected for routing or scoring that could equally happen after the lead exists.

Where fields genuinely cannot be cut, enrich rather than ask: a submitted work email plus enrichment
usually recovers company, size and industry without asking for any of them.

## Social Proof Placement Beats Social Proof Volume

Adding social proof lifts form conversion by roughly **26%**, and placement matters as much as
presence: trust signals positioned **within visual proximity of the form** improve completion by
around **12%** over the same signals placed elsewhere on the page.

So the rule is not "add testimonials". It is: put the proof where the hesitation happens. A logo wall
in the hero and a testimonial in the footer leave the form itself unsupported, which is exactly the
moment the reader decides.

Prefer specific over decorative: a named customer with a number outperforms a logo grid, and a
testimonial that names the objection it answers outperforms one that praises the product generally.
