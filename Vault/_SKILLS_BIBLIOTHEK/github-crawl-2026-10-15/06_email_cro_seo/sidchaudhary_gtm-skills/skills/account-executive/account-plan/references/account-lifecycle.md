## Account Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Description | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Prospect** | Account identified as a potential customer. No revenue relationship. | Matches ICP, added to target account list | Signs contract (→ Customer Active) or disqualified (→ Disqualified) |
| **Customer Active** | Paying customer with healthy engagement and usage. | Contract signed, onboarding complete | Health score drops below 40 (→ Customer At Risk) or contract lapses (→ Customer Churned) |
| **Customer At Risk** | Paying customer showing declining engagement or satisfaction signals. | Health score < 40, or 2+ churn risk indicators present | Health score recovers above 60 (→ Customer Active) or contract expires without renewal (→ Customer Churned) |
| **Customer Churned** | Former customer who did not renew or explicitly cancelled. | Non-renewal, cancellation, or contract expiration | Re-engagement and new contract (→ Customer Active) |
| **Disqualified** | Account does not match ICP or was evaluated and rejected. | Failed qualification, bad fit, fraud, or explicit disinterest | Re-evaluation if circumstances change (→ Prospect) |

### Stage Transition Diagram

## Buying Committee Roles

### Role Definitions

| Role | Description | Engagement Priority | Key Concerns |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Champion** | Internal advocate who actively pushes for your solution. Has personal motivation and organizational influence. | Critical, nurture and arm with internal selling tools | "How does this make me look good?" "How do I build the business case?" |
| **Economic Buyer** | Person with signing authority and budget control. Makes the final financial decision. | High, need their buy-in for deal to close | ROI, total cost of ownership, risk, strategic alignment |
| **Technical Evaluator** | Assesses technical fit, integration requirements, security, and implementation feasibility. | High, can veto on technical grounds | API capabilities, security, data model, integration, scalability |
| **End User** | Day-to-day user of the product. Their adoption determines success. | Medium, ensure usability and value realization | Ease of use, workflow fit, learning curve, daily value |
| **Blocker** | Stakeholder who resists the purchase. May be attached to incumbent solution, skeptical of change, or have competing priorities. | High, identify and neutralize or convert early | Disruption, risk, learning curve, political implications |

### Engagement Approach per Role

| Role | Communication Style | Content Types | Meeting Approach |
|------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Champion | Collaborative, empowering | Battle cards, ROI templates, internal pitch decks | Regular 1:1s, arm with ammunition |
| Economic Buyer | Executive, concise, ROI-focused | Executive summaries, business cases, peer references | Exec-to-exec meetings, board-ready materials |
| Technical Evaluator | Technical, detailed, honest about limitations | API docs, architecture diagrams, security whitepapers, sandbox access | Technical deep dives, POC support |
| End User | Practical, empathetic, user-focused | Product tours, training materials, quick-start guides | Hands-on workshops, user feedback sessions |
| Blocker | Respectful, empathetic, address concerns directly | Competitive comparisons, risk mitigation plans, transition guides | Dedicated concern-addressing sessions |

## Multi-Threading Assessment

Multi-threading = engaging multiple contacts at an account. Critical for deal resilience and acceleration.

### Threading Score

| Threads (Engaged Contacts) | Score | Risk Level |
|----------------------------|-------|------------|
| 5+ contacts across multiple roles | Strong | Low risk |
| 3-4 contacts across 2+ roles | Good | Moderate risk |
| 2 contacts (e.g., champion + evaluator) | Adequate | Elevated risk |
| 1 contact only (single-threaded) | Weak | High risk, deal depends on one person |
| 0 active contacts | Critical | Deal is dead; re-engagement needed |

### Multi-Threading Strategies

| Strategy | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Champion expansion** | Ask champion to introduce you to other stakeholders | After champion is committed and confident |
| **Content-based threading** | Share relevant content tagged to specific roles | Ongoing, use industry reports for execs, technical docs for evaluators |
| **Event-based threading** | Invite multiple contacts to webinars, dinners, conferences | During consideration/evaluation phase |
| **Referral threading** | Leverage existing contacts at the account to introduce you to new teams | When entering new departments or business units |
| **Executive threading** | Have your executive reach out to their executive | When deal is stalling or needs executive alignment |
| **Org chart mapping** | Systematically identify and reach every relevant stakeholder | At deal start; revisit quarterly for existing customers |

## Engagement Strategy Matrix: Stage x Role

| Stage | Champion | Economic Buyer | Technical Evaluator | End User |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Prospect** | Identify and develop. Share industry insights. Build relationship. | Map and plan approach. No direct outreach until champion engaged. | Identify through champion. Prepare technical materials. | Not yet engaged. |
| **Customer Active** | Regular check-ins. Share product roadmap. Seek feedback. | QBR presentations. ROI reviews. Expansion discussions. | Technical health checks. Integration support. | Training. Adoption support. Feature updates. |
| **Customer At Risk** | Urgent 1:1. Understand root cause. Co-create recovery plan. | Executive escalation. Remediation commitment. Retention offer if warranted. | Technical review. Address issues. Priority support. | Usability improvements. Re-training. Quick wins. |
| **Customer Churned** | Maintain relationship. Share relevant updates quarterly. | Annual check-in with new value prop or company news. | No active engagement. | No active engagement. |

## Account Expansion Indicators

Signals that an existing customer is ready for upsell, cross-sell, or expansion.

| Indicator | Expansion Type | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Usage approaching plan limits** | Upsell (higher tier) | Proactive upgrade discussion before they hit limits |
| **New use case exploration** | Cross-sell (new product/module) | Discovery call about the new use case, demonstrate fit |
| **Additional team members** | Seat expansion | Offer team training, volume pricing discussion |
| **Positive NPS (9-10)** | Referral + expansion | Ask for referral, introduce expansion options |
| **API usage growth** | Platform expansion | Technical expansion discussion, integration support |
| **Requesting features from higher tier** | Upsell | Show ROI of upgrading, offer trial of premium features |
| **New department adoption** | Land-and-expand | Department-specific demo, new champion development |
| **Increased login frequency** | Deepening engagement | Share advanced feature guides, offer power-user training |
| **Multi-year contract interest** | Commitment expansion | Offer discount for longer commitment, lock in renewal |

### Expansion Playbook

```
1. Detect expansion signal (automated via product usage data or manual via CSM observation)
2. Validate the signal (is it a real expansion need or just noise?)
3. Identify the right stakeholder for expansion conversation
4. Prepare expansion-specific value proposition
5. Schedule expansion discovery call
6. Present tailored proposal with ROI
7. Negotiate and close expansion
8. Onboard the expansion (new features, users, or departments)
```

## Account Health Benchmarks (Directional)

These are illustrative ranges for calibration, not benchmarks tied to a specific published study. Account health distributions, churn timing, and expansion rates vary significantly by industry, ACV, and company maturity, and no single authoritative source covers all of them. Treat every number below as directional, not guaranteed: a rough sense of shape to check your own data against, not a target or an external citation.

### Account Health Distribution

In a typical B2B SaaS customer base, health scores often cluster loosely like this, though the actual split varies a lot by product and segment:

| Health Band | Typical % of Accounts | Revenue Risk | Action |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------|--------|
| Healthy (70-100) | roughly 45-60% | Low | Prioritize expansion plays |
| Watch (40-69) | roughly 25-35% | Medium | Proactive check-ins, engagement campaigns |
| At Risk (0-39) | roughly 10-20% | High | Immediate intervention required |

### Churn Prediction Windows

Directional only. Actual time-to-churn after any given signal depends heavily on product, contract length, and how fast a team responds:

| Signal | Approximate Days to Churn |
|--------|----------------------|
| No login for 21+ days | roughly 45-60 days |
| Support escalation (critical) | roughly 30-45 days |
| Declining feature usage (3 consecutive weeks) | roughly 60-90 days |
| NPS drop below 6 | roughly 90-120 days |
| Champion departure | roughly 30-90 days |

**Directional pattern worth watching for:** a meaningful share of an active customer base, commonly discussed in the 20-30% range though this is not a fixed figure, shows early churn signals at any given moment. Accounts that get proactive outreach before signals compound generally renew at a noticeably higher rate than accounts reached later, though there's no single reliable multiplier to cite.

### Expansion Revenue Benchmarks

Varies significantly by segment and pricing model - illustrative ranges, not measured averages:

| Metric | SMB | Mid-Market | Enterprise |
|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|
| % of ARR from expansion | roughly 15-25% | roughly 25-40% | roughly 35-55% |
| Upsell close rate | roughly 30-40% | roughly 40-50% | roughly 45-55% |
| Cross-sell attach rate | roughly 15-25% | roughly 20-30% | roughly 25-40% |
| Expansion ARR growth (healthy) | roughly 20-30% YoY | roughly 30-45% YoY | roughly 40-60% YoY |
| Avg months to first expansion | roughly 9-12 | roughly 6-9 | roughly 12-18 |

### Customer Success Impact on Retention

Directional pattern, not a guaranteed outcome. A more proactive CS motion generally correlates with better retention, but the magnitude varies a lot by business:

| CS Coverage Model | Net Retention Rate | Gross Revenue Churn |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| No CS (product-led only) | roughly 94-100% | roughly 10-18% |
| Reactive CS (ticket-driven) | roughly 99-104% | roughly 8-12% |
| Proactive CS (health score-driven) | roughly 104-110% | roughly 5-8% |
| High-touch enterprise CS | roughly 110-125% | roughly 3-5% |

## Churn Risk Indicators

Signals that a customer may not renew or may cancel.

| Indicator | Severity | Detection Method |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **Declining usage** (week-over-week decrease for 3+ weeks) | High | Product analytics, DAU/WAU trends |
| **Support escalations** (2+ escalations in 30 days) | High | Support ticket data, severity and escalation flags |
| **Competitor evaluation** (visiting competitor sites, asking about alternatives) | High | Intent data, direct mentions in conversations |
| **Contract renewal approaching** (< 60 days) with no renewal signal | High | CRM contract data |
| **Champion departure** (key contact left the company) | Critical | LinkedIn monitoring, email bounces, direct notification |
| **Payment issues** (late payments, disputed invoices) | Medium-High | Billing system data |
| **Declining NPS/CSAT** (score dropped by 2+ points) | Medium | Survey data trends |
| **Reduced meeting frequency** (CSM check-ins declined or cancelled) | Medium | Calendar data |
| **Feature requests not addressed** (3+ outstanding requests > 90 days) | Medium | Product feedback system |
| **Organizational change** (merger, acquisition, leadership change) | Medium | News monitoring, direct communication |
| **Budget cuts announced** | High | News, direct communication |
| **Low adoption of new features** (not using features released in last 6 months) | Low-Medium | Product analytics |

### Churn Prevention Framework

```
Early Warning (health 40-69):
  → CSM proactive check-in within 48 hours
  → Review usage data and identify engagement gaps
  → Create re-engagement plan with specific milestones

Urgent Risk (health 20-39):
  → Escalate to CSM manager
  → Executive-to-executive outreach
  → Offer remediation: dedicated support, training, customization
  → Create 30-day recovery plan with weekly checkpoints

Critical Risk (health 0-19):
  → VP/C-level escalation
  → Retention offer if warranted (discount, contract flexibility)
  → Post-mortem if churn is likely, capture learnings
  → Begin transition planning (graceful offboarding)
```

## Committee Size and Threading

**The committee has roughly doubled in a decade.** Average B2B buying-group size has moved from ~5.4
stakeholders in 2014, to ~6.8 in 2020, to ~8.2 in 2024, to **11+ in 2026**, with Forrester and 6sense
both putting the median near **11.2 people for deals above $50K**.

What sellers actually plan for is smaller than that, which is the gap worth noticing:

| Segment | Titles the seller typically plans for |
|---|---|
| SMB | ~4.6 |
| Mid-market | ~5.6 |
| Enterprise | ~6.0 (though ~21% list 6-8 and ~14% name 9+) |

So a "fully threaded" enterprise plan naming six people is covering roughly half the group that will
actually decide.

**Threading is worth more than almost anything else measurable.** Reaching five or more stakeholders
has been reported closing at **~30% against ~5% single-threaded**, about a 6x difference. Other
studies put it at **+130% win rate on deals above $50K**, and cross-department threading at **+56%**.

### The contradiction to resolve before quoting either number

There is a second, apparently opposite finding: deals with **1-3 stakeholders close at 38-52%**, while
deals with **10+ close at 18-30%**. Read naively, that says fewer stakeholders is better and
multithreading is pointless.

Both are true, and the resolution is that **committee size is a property of the deal, not a choice**.
Large deals have large committees and are structurally harder to win. Multithreading is what you do
*about* that, not a thing you add to a deal to make it bigger. So:

- **Never read low-stakeholder win rates as an argument against threading.** The comparison is
  confounded by deal size. The right comparison is threaded versus single-threaded *within* the same
  deal size, and that comparison favours threading heavily.
- **Do not add stakeholders to a small deal** because the benchmark says more is better. A three-person
  SMB deal threaded to eight people is a slower three-person deal.
- **Judge coverage against the committee this deal actually has**, not against an absolute count.

### Threading depth, relative rather than absolute

An absolute "5+ contacts is Strong" ages badly against a committee that has doubled in size. Assess
coverage as a **share of the committee this deal actually has**, and record both numbers:

| Coverage | Read |
|---|---|
| Most of the identified committee, including the economic buyer | Strong |
| Around half, economic buyer engaged | Adequate |
| Around half, economic buyer **not** engaged | At risk regardless of the count |
| One or two contacts on a committee of 8+ | Weak, and the count understates the risk |
| Single-threaded at any deal size | High risk, and the single point of failure should be named |

**The economic buyer is not one contact among several.** Coverage that misses them is at risk whatever
the headcount says, so weight that role rather than counting heads.
