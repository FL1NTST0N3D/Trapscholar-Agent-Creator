## Stage Definitions

### Standard Sales Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Description | Key Activities | Typical Duration |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Prospecting** | Initial outreach and identification of potential buyers | Cold outreach, inbound lead capture, research, initial qualification | 7-14 days |
| **Qualification** | Determining if the prospect has a real need and is worth pursuing | Discovery calls, BANT/MEDDIC assessment, ICP validation | 7-21 days |
| **Discovery/Demo** | Deep dive into needs and demonstration of solution fit | Product demos, technical evaluation, requirements gathering, pain exploration | 14-30 days |
| **Proposal** | Formal proposal, pricing, and scope presentation | Proposal creation, pricing discussion, ROI presentation, stakeholder alignment | 7-14 days |
| **Negotiation** | Contract terms, pricing finalization, legal review | Contract redlining, procurement, security review, terms negotiation | 7-21 days |
| **Won** | Deal closed, contract signed | Contract execution, handoff to customer success, implementation planning | -- |
| **Lost** | Deal lost at any stage | Loss reason documentation, post-mortem analysis | -- |

---

## Deal Velocity

Deal velocity measures the average number of days a deal spends in each stage. Deals that significantly exceed the average are flagged as "stuck."

### Average Days per Stage (Benchmarks)

| Stage | SMB (< $10K ACV) | Mid-Market ($10K-$50K) | Enterprise ($50K+) |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Prospecting | 5-7 days | 7-14 days | 14-21 days |
| Qualification | 3-7 days | 7-14 days | 14-30 days |
| Discovery/Demo | 7-14 days | 14-21 days | 21-45 days |
| Proposal | 3-7 days | 7-14 days | 14-30 days |
| Negotiation | 3-7 days | 7-14 days | 14-30 days |
| **Total cycle** | **21-42 days** | **42-77 days** | **77-156 days** |

### Stuck Deal Detection

```
A deal is "stuck" when:
  days_in_current_stage > 2 × average_days_for_stage_and_segment
```

| Stuck Level | Multiplier | Action |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Warning | 1.5x average | Flag for review in next pipeline meeting |
| Stuck | 2x average | Require action plan from rep within 48 hours |
| Critical | 3x average | Escalate to manager; consider deprioritizing |

### Velocity Calculation

This formula measures pipeline/sales velocity (total revenue throughput over time), not individual deal speed (days a specific deal spends in a stage).

```
Deal Velocity = (Number of Deals × Average Deal Value × Win Rate) / Average Sales Cycle Length

Example:
  100 deals × $25,000 × 25% win rate / 60 days = $10,417 revenue per day
```

---

## Risk Signals

Factors that indicate a deal may be at risk of stalling or loss.

| Risk Signal | Severity | Detection |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Single-threaded** | High | Only 1 contact engaged at the account |
| **No activity 14+ days** | High | No emails, calls, meetings, or updates in 14+ days |
| **Declining intent** | High | Intent score trending downward over 14+ days |
| **Missing BANT elements** | Medium-High | 2+ BANT elements not addressed (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) |
| **No next step scheduled** | Medium | No future meeting or action item on the calendar |
| **Competitor mentioned** | Medium | Prospect has mentioned evaluating alternatives |
| **Champion gone silent** | High | Previously active champion has stopped responding |
| **Decision process unclear** | Medium | No documented decision process or timeline |
| **Budget not confirmed** | Medium | Deal in Proposal+ stage without confirmed budget |
| **Contract stalled** | High | Legal/procurement review exceeding 2x average duration |
| **Stakeholder change** | High | Key contact has left the company or changed roles |
| **Scope creep** | Medium | Requirements expanding without corresponding budget increase |
| **Decreasing meeting attendance** | Medium | Fewer prospect stakeholders attending each meeting |

### Risk Scoring

Each risk signal carries a weight. Total risk score = sum of active risk weights.

| Risk Level | Total Weight | Action |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Low (0-15) | 0-15 points | Normal management |
| Medium (16-30) | 16-30 points | Proactive intervention needed |
| High (31-50) | 31-50 points | Urgent action required; escalate |
| Critical (51+) | 51+ points | Consider deprioritizing or disqualifying |

## Forecast Categories

### Category Definitions

| Category | Probability Range | Criteria |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| **Commit** | > 90% | Verbal/written confirmation, contract in signature, procurement processing |
| **Best Case** | 60-90% | Strong champion, proposal accepted, negotiating terms |
| **Pipeline** | 30-60% | Active engagement, demo completed, proposal pending or delivered |
| **Omit** | < 30% | Early stage, no clear path to close, stalled, or unqualified |

### Forecast Accuracy Measurement

```
Forecast Accuracy = 1 - |Forecasted Revenue - Actual Revenue| / Actual Revenue

Targets:
  Commit accuracy: > 90%
  Best Case accuracy: > 70%
  Pipeline accuracy: > 50%
  Overall weighted accuracy: > 75%
```

### Category Movement Rules

| From → To | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| Pipeline → Best Case | Champion confirmed, proposal delivered, timeline confirmed |
| Best Case → Commit | Verbal yes, contract sent for signature |
| Any → Omit | Stalled > 3x average, champion lost, budget cut, competitor selected |
| Omit → Pipeline | Re-engagement detected, new champion, renewed interest |

## Win Rate Benchmarks by Stage

The probability of winning a deal given it has reached a particular stage.

| Stage | Win Rate (SMB) | Win Rate (Mid-Market) | Win Rate (Enterprise) |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Prospecting | 5-8% | 3-5% | 2-4% |
| Qualification | 15-20% | 12-18% | 10-15% |
| Discovery/Demo | 30-40% | 25-35% | 20-30% |
| Proposal | 50-60% | 45-55% | 40-50% |
| Negotiation | 70-80% | 65-75% | 60-70% |

### Directional Win Rate Patterns (No Single Authoritative Benchmark)

Several sales intelligence and RevOps vendors publish B2B win rate research, but the exact percentages differ by vendor, sample, and year, and none of it is independently reproducible across sources. Several published reports point to a compression trend in recent years due to economic pressure and increased competition, but treat any specific figure as directional, not guaranteed:

| Metric | Direction | Caveat |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Overall B2B SaaS win rate | Commonly cited in the high teens to low twenties percent | Varies significantly by vendor, sample, and methodology; no single authoritative figure |
| SMB vs. Mid-Market vs. Enterprise win rate | SMB tends to win at a higher rate than Enterprise, given shorter cycles and fewer stakeholders | Exact ranges not consistently reproducible across sources |
| Demo to close rate | Varies widely by product and motion | No authoritative cross-industry benchmark; measure your own funnel instead |
| Competitive vs. uncontested win rate | Deals with no named competitor close at a meaningfully higher rate than contested deals | Magnitude varies significantly by source |
| Multi-threaded vs. single-threaded win rate | Multi-threaded deals win at a meaningfully higher rate, especially at larger deal sizes | Whether that is roughly 2x or a different multiple is not consistent across sources |
| Average sales cycle length | Scales with deal size and segment as expected (SMB shortest, Enterprise longest) | Exact day ranges vary widely by vendor and industry; use your own historical data as the baseline |

### Win Rate Trend Analysis

Track win rates by:
- Stage (are deals stalling at a specific stage?)
- Rep (who needs coaching at which stage?)
- Segment (which segments convert best?)
- Source (which lead sources produce highest-quality pipeline?)
- Deal size (does close rate vary by deal value?)

---

## Pipeline Coverage Ratio

The ratio of total pipeline value to the revenue target.

```
Pipeline Coverage = Total Weighted Pipeline / Revenue Target

Where:
  Weighted Pipeline = Σ (deal_value × stage_win_rate)
```

| Coverage Ratio | Health | Action |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| > 4x | Over-covered | Focus on quality and deal velocity, not new pipeline |
| 3-4x | Healthy | Balanced, maintain pipeline generation cadence |
| 2-3x | Thin | Increase pipeline generation, expand prospecting |
| 1-2x | At Risk | Urgent pipeline generation needed, consider lowering target |
| < 1x | Critical | Target likely unachievable, restructure pipeline plan |

### Coverage by Segment

Track coverage separately for each segment, product line, or team:

```
Enterprise pipeline coverage: 3.2x (Healthy)
Mid-Market pipeline coverage: 2.1x (Thin, increase prospecting)
SMB pipeline coverage: 4.5x (Over-covered, focus on conversion)
```

## Quadrant Analysis: Health x Intent Matrix

Plot deals on a 2x2 matrix using Health Score (Y-axis) and Intent Score (X-axis).

```
                 High Health
                     |
    RE-ENGAGE        |         STRONG
    (High Health,    |    (High Health,
     Low Intent)     |     High Intent)
                     |
  -------------------+-------------------
                     |
    DEPRIORITIZE     |         UNBLOCK
    (Low Health,     |    (Low Health,
     Low Intent)     |     High Intent)
                     |
                 Low Health
     Low Intent <----+----> High Intent
```

### Quadrant Actions

| Quadrant | Health | Intent | Strategy |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Strong** | High (60+) | High (60+) | Priority deals. Accelerate to close. Remove friction. Get proposal/contract out. |
| **Re-engage** | High (60+) | Low (< 60) | Deal is healthy but prospect is not ready. Continue education, build value, wait for intent signals. |
| **Unblock** | Low (< 60) | High (60+) | Prospect wants to buy but the deal is poorly managed. Fix health issues: re-engage stakeholders, address stalled stages, inject urgency. |
| **Deprioritize** | Low (< 60) | Low (< 60) | Neither healthy nor showing intent. Move to long-term nurture, reduce investment, consider disqualifying. |

## Scoring Weights

Default weights are provided below. These are configurable per business to match their sales motion.

### Health Score Weights

| Component | Default Weight | Adjustment Guidance |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Deal Progression Velocity | 25% | Increase for transactional sales; decrease for enterprise |
| Activity Recency | 25% | Increase if your sales cycle is fast; decrease for long cycles |
| Engagement Depth | 20% | Increase for complex, multi-stakeholder deals |
| Stakeholder Coverage | 15% | Increase for enterprise; decrease for SMB self-serve |
| BANT Completeness | 15% | Increase for high-ticket deals; decrease for low-touch sales |

### Intent Score Weights

| Component | Default Weight | Adjustment Guidance |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Website Visits | 20% | Increase for PLG companies; decrease for sales-led outbound |
| Content Consumption | 20% | Increase if content marketing is a primary channel |
| Feature Usage | 20% | Increase for product-led growth; decrease if no trial/freemium |
| Meeting Frequency | 20% | Increase for enterprise sales-led motion |
| Email Engagement | 20% | Increase for outbound-heavy teams |

### Weight Recalibration

Recalibrate weights quarterly by analyzing:
1. Which components most strongly correlated with won deals?
2. Which components most strongly correlated with lost deals?
3. Are there components with no predictive value? (Consider removing or replacing.)

Use logistic regression on historical deal data to optimize weights empirically.

## Forecast Accuracy: What "Commit" Is Actually Worth

Any scoring model here feeds a forecast, so the forecast's real accuracy sets the ceiling on what the
scores are worth. That accuracy is lower than most teams believe.

| Measure | Figure |
|---|---|
| Typical B2B forecast accuracy | **±15-25%** |
| High performers | **±5-10%** |
| Companies achieving 90%+ accuracy | **~7%** |
| Forecasted deals that **slip to the next quarter** | **~60%** |

**A 60% slip rate is the number that matters.** It means a deal sitting in Commit is more likely than not
to move, so "Commit" describes a rep's confidence rather than a timing prediction. Reporting a Commit
total as though it were next quarter's revenue is the single most common forecasting error, and it is not
a modelling problem, it is a labelling one.

### The misses are operational, not statistical

Forecast error clusters around four causes, none of which a better scoring formula fixes:

1. **Rep subjectivity.** Stage and confidence are set by the person whose number depends on them.
2. **CRM data gaps.** Missing fields silently default rather than flagging.
3. **Loose stage design.** Stages defined by activity ("demo done") rather than by buyer evidence
   ("buyer confirmed budget and timeline") let a deal advance without anything changing.
4. **No reconciliation between sales and finance records.** Two systems, two totals, and the difference
   is discovered at quarter end.

The implication for any score built here: **methodology and input quality drive accuracy far more than
the weighting does.** Re-tuning weights on data the reps enter about themselves moves nothing. Fix the
stage definitions and the input provenance first.

### What to do with this in practice

- **Report the slip rate alongside the forecast**, where history allows. A team that has historically
  slipped 60% of Commit should not present Commit as a plan.
- **Calibrate the categories against outcomes**, not against intent. If Commit historically closes at
  60%, it is a Best Case bucket wearing the wrong label, and renaming it is more honest than coaching
  the reps.
- **Define stages by buyer evidence, not seller activity.** "We ran a demo" is something you did.
  "They confirmed budget, timeline and the decision process" is something they did, and only the second
  predicts anything.
- **Say when the forecast is uncalibrated.** With no history to check categories against, the totals are
  a restatement of the reps' optimism, and presenting them without that caveat is the error above.
