## Talk Ratio Benchmarks

The percentage of time the sales rep talks versus listens during a conversation.

| Talk Ratio (Rep) | Rating | Description |
|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| < 30% | Too passive | Rep is not guiding the conversation or sharing enough value |
| 30-40% | Good for discovery | Appropriate for early discovery calls, mostly listening |
| 40-60% | Ideal range | Balanced conversation, the golden zone |
| 60-70% | Leaning monologue | Rep is talking too much; risk of losing prospect |
| > 70% | Monologue | Rep is dominating; prospect is disengaged |

### Talk Ratio by Call Type

| Call Type | Ideal Rep Talk % | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Discovery | 30-40% | Listen to understand pain, let prospect talk |
| Demo | 50-60% | Presenting, but with interactive Q&A |
| Negotiation | 40-50% | Balanced, presenting offers, hearing concerns |
| Follow-up | 35-45% | Checking understanding, addressing questions |
| Closing | 40-55% | Summarizing, handling last objections, asking for the deal |

### Directional Patterns (No Single Authoritative Benchmark)

Conversation intelligence vendors publish talk-ratio and monologue research, but the exact percentages and thresholds vary by vendor, methodology, and year, and none of it is independently reproducible across sources. Treat the following as directional, not guaranteed:

| Pattern | Direction | Caveat |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Top performer talk ratio | Tends to run lower than average reps, roughly in the 40s% | Varies by call type and by which study you read; no single number is authoritative |
| Questions per call | Top performers generally ask more, and more open-ended, questions than average reps | Exact counts vary widely by industry and deal size |
| Longest monologue | Shorter uninterrupted talk stretches correlate with better outcomes across most published research | Specific second thresholds differ by source and are not consistently reproducible |
| Multi-threading impact | Deals with multiple engaged stakeholders win at meaningfully higher rates than single-threaded deals | Magnitude (whether that is roughly 2x or higher) varies significantly by deal size and source |
| Collaborative language ("we/us") | Directionally associated with better outcomes in most vendor research | No consistent multiplier across studies; treat as a coaching signal, not a scored metric |
| Pricing timing | Introducing pricing after value is established tends to correlate with higher win rates | Magnitude not consistently reproducible across sources; use as qualitative guidance |

## Patience Score

Measures how long the rep waits in silence before interrupting or filling the gap.

| Silence Duration | Rating | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| > 5 seconds | Excellent | Comfortable with silence; prospect feels space to think |
| 3-5 seconds | Good | Adequate patience; allows prospect to complete thoughts |
| 2-3 seconds | Average | Acceptable but could improve |
| 1-2 seconds | Below average | Jumping in too quickly; prospect may feel rushed |
| < 1 second | Poor | Interrupting or overlapping; prospect will disengage |

### Measurement

- Track the gap between the prospect finishing a statement and the rep starting their next statement
- Average across all conversation turns
- Identify instances of overlap (negative silence = interruption)
- Flag interruptions separately: count of times rep spoke before prospect finished

---

## Longest Monologue

The longest uninterrupted stretch of the rep talking without asking a question or receiving input.

| Duration | Rating | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| < 30 seconds | Excellent | Highly conversational, engaged prospect |
| 30-60 seconds | Good | Appropriate for demos and presentations |
| 60-90 seconds | Caution | Getting long, prospect attention may wander |
| > 90 seconds | Problem | Losing prospect attention; needs to break up with a question |
| > 120 seconds | Critical | Almost certainly lost the prospect; monologue mode |

### Remediation

When longest monologue > 90 seconds, coaching recommendation:

- Insert a check-in question every 60 seconds: "Does that make sense so far?" or "How does that compare to what you're doing today?"
- Break presentations into segments with interactive transitions
- Use the "teach-ask" pattern: share an insight, then ask how it relates to their situation

## Interactivity Score (0-100)

A composite metric measuring how conversational and engaged the call is.

### Components

| Component | Weight | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Question rate | 30% | Questions asked per 10 minutes |
| Turn-taking frequency | 25% | Number of speaker switches per minute |
| Balanced talk ratio | 20% | Proximity to ideal 50/50 split |
| Prospect engagement | 15% | Length and depth of prospect responses |
| Silence comfort | 10% | Average pause duration before response |

### Score Ranges

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 80-100 | Highly Interactive | Dynamic, collaborative conversation with balanced exchange |
| 60-79 | Interactive | Good back-and-forth with occasional long stretches |
| 40-59 | Moderately Interactive | Some dialogue but too much one-way talking |
| 20-39 | Low Interactivity | Dominated by one speaker; feels like a presentation |
| 0-19 | Monologue | One-way communication; not a conversation |

---

## Question Rate

The number of questions the rep asks per 10-minute window.

| Rate | Rating | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 5+ per 10 min | Over-questioning | Feels like an interrogation; balance with insights |
| 3-5 per 10 min | Ideal | Genuine curiosity driving productive dialogue |
| 2-3 per 10 min | Adequate | Room for improvement; should probe deeper |
| 1-2 per 10 min | Low | Presenting more than discovering |
| < 1 per 10 min | Critical | Not asking questions; cannot qualify or understand needs |

### Question Quality Taxonomy

| Question Type | Quality | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Open-ended | High | "What's driving the need to solve this now?" |
| Probing | High | "Can you tell me more about how that impacts your team?" |
| Clarifying | Medium-High | "When you say 'too slow,' what specifically do you mean?" |
| Confirming | Medium | "So the main issue is X, is that right?" |
| Closed (yes/no) | Low-Medium | "Are you using [tool] today?" |
| Leading | Low | "You'd agree that faster is better, right?" |
| Loaded | Avoid | "Why haven't you fixed this already?" |

| **Timing** | "not now", "next quarter", "not a priority", "busy", "revisit later", "bad timing" | "We're focused on other things right now" |
| **Competition** | "already using", "competitor", "evaluated", "compared", "alternative", "other vendors" | "We're already working with [competitor]" |
| **Status Quo** | "working fine", "don't need", "not broken", "current solution", "happy with" | "What we have works well enough" |
| **Authority** | "need to check", "not my decision", "talk to my boss", "committee", "approval" | "I'd need to get buy-in from my VP" |

---

## Sentiment Scoring

### Breakdown

| Sentiment | Definition | Indicators |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Positive** | Prospect is engaged, interested, enthusiastic | Asking follow-up questions, expressing interest ("that's interesting"), affirming ("yes, exactly"), discussing next steps, using future tense ("when we implement") |
| **Neutral** | Prospect is listening but not committed | Short responses, factual questions, no emotional language, neither enthusiastic nor resistant |
| **Negative** | Prospect is resistant, skeptical, or disengaged | Objections, pushback, skeptical questions ("but what about..."), short/dismissive responses, disengagement cues ("I need to go"), challenges ("prove it") |

### Sentiment Trajectory

| Pattern | Interpretation | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Positive → Positive | Strong engagement throughout | Move to next stage confidently |
| Neutral → Positive | Warming up; message is landing | Continue current approach, accelerate CTA |
| Positive → Negative | Something went wrong mid-call | Identify the trigger, address the concern directly |
| Negative → Positive | Objection successfully handled | Reinforce the resolution, build on positive momentum |
| Negative → Negative | Not landing; prospect is not a fit or approach is wrong | Reconsider qualification, try a different angle, or gracefully exit |

## Coaching Output Structure

Every conversation analysis should produce a structured coaching report.

### 1. Strengths

What the rep did well, reinforce these behaviors.

```
Strengths:
- Strong opening: established credibility in first 30 seconds with a relevant trigger event
- Excellent discovery questions at 4:20 and 7:15, open-ended and pain-probing
- Good patience score (4.2s average), let the prospect think
- Handled pricing objection at 18:30 with quantified ROI response
```

### 2. Weaknesses

Areas for improvement, specific, actionable, not personal.

```
Weaknesses:
- Longest monologue of 2:15 at 12:00-14:15, lost prospect attention (their responses shortened after)
- Talk ratio skewed to 65%, too much presenting, not enough dialogue
- Did not ask about timeline or budget, BANT incomplete
- Missed opportunity to multi-thread when prospect mentioned "my team would need to see this"
```

### 3. Specific Rewrites (with Timestamps)

Concrete, word-for-word alternatives for specific moments.

```
Rewrites:

[12:30] Instead of: "Let me walk you through all of our features..."
        Try: "Which of these areas is most relevant to your situation? I'll focus there."

[18:45] Instead of: "Our pricing is very competitive."
        Try: "Teams your size typically see a 3x ROI within 6 months, let me show you the math."

[22:10] Instead of: "Let me know if you have any questions."
        Try: "Based on what we discussed, what would need to be true for you to move forward?"
```

### 4. Recommended Drills

Targeted practice exercises to build specific skills.

| Drill | Description | Duration | Frequency |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **60-second teach-ask** | Present a value point in 60 seconds, then ask a question | 15 min | 2x/week |
| **Question ladder** | Practice asking 3 escalating questions on any topic | 10 min | Daily |
| **Objection handling** | Role-play top 3 objections with a partner | 20 min | Weekly |
| **Silence tolerance** | Practice 5-second pauses after asking a question | 10 min | Daily |
| **BANT check** | After every mock call, score BANT from memory | 5 min | After every call |
| **3x3 research** | Practice finding 3 personalized insights in 3 minutes | 3 min | Before every call |
| **Closing pivot** | Practice transitioning from any topic to a next-step ask | 10 min | 2x/week |

## What the Conversation Data Actually Supports

These are the three metrics most call-coaching tools report, with what the large-sample data says and,
more importantly, how strong a signal each one really is. Coaching a weak signal hard is how a rep ends
up optimising a dashboard instead of a conversation.

### Talk ratio: a real effect, and a small one

The widely quoted target is around **43:57 rep-to-prospect**. The measured reality across large call
samples is closer to a **60/40** average, and, the part that usually gets left out, **the gap between
won and lost deals is about 5 percentage points**: roughly **57% rep talk time on closed-won** against
**62% on lost**.

Two consequences:

- **Talk ratio is a weak discriminator on its own.** A five-point spread means it separates won from
  lost only faintly. A rep at 62% is not failing, and moving them to 57% is a marginal intervention.
  Presenting it as the headline fix overstates it.
- **The tail is where it matters.** Above roughly **65%** rep talk time, win rates fall off more
  clearly. So the useful coaching target is not "hit 43%", it is "do not exceed 65%", which is a much
  easier and more honest ask.

Treat talk ratio as a **screen**, not a diagnosis: it flags calls worth listening to, and the reason the
call was lost is in what was said, not in the ratio.

### Discovery questions: fewer, not more

This one runs against the usual advice. In calls that closed, top reps asked around **15-16 questions**;
in lost calls the count was nearer **20**. Other analyses put the effective range at **11-14 questions
in a 30-minute discovery**.

More questions correlate with *worse* outcomes, and the mechanism is legible: a long question list gets
worked through like a checklist, which produces short answers and no follow-through. Fewer, open
questions that build on the previous answer produce longer answers and more usable information.

So **never coach "ask more discovery questions" from a low question count alone.** Ask whether the
questions were open, and whether each one followed from the last. A rep asking 20 closed questions has a
worse call than one asking 12 that build.

### Monologue length: the one with a clean threshold

Top reps keep continuous uninterrupted speech under about **76 seconds**. This is the most actionable of
the three because it is concrete, easy to observe, and easy to change.

And the inverse metric matters more than the direct one: the **longest uninterrupted prospect
monologue** correlates with engagement and deal progression. The goal is not primarily to shorten the
rep's monologue, it is to lengthen the prospect's. A rep who talks in short bursts but never lets the
prospect run is still not getting discovery.

### How to weight these when coaching

Rank by signal strength, not by ease of measurement:

1. **Longest prospect monologue**, did they ever really talk?
2. **Rep monologue over 76 seconds**, concrete, fixable
3. **Question quality**, open, and building on the last answer
4. **Talk ratio**, a screen, and only the >65% tail is a clear finding
5. **Question count**, nearly useless alone, and misleading if coached upward
