## Metric Calculation Formulas

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers Acquired

Components of spend:
  + Sales team compensation (including commission)
  + Marketing team compensation
  + Advertising spend
  + Marketing tools and software
  + Content production costs
  + Event costs
  / New customers in the same period

Period alignment: match spend period to acquisition period (typically monthly or quarterly)
```

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

```
LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin × Average Customer Lifetime (months)

Where:
  ARPU = Average Revenue Per User per month
  Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue (typically 70-85% for SaaS)
  Average Customer Lifetime = 1 / Monthly Churn Rate

Example:
  ARPU = $100/month
  Gross Margin = 80%
  Monthly Churn = 2% → Lifetime = 50 months
  LTV = $100 × 0.80 × 50 = $4,000
```

### Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

```
ROAS = Revenue Attributed to Ads / Ad Spend

Example:
  Revenue from paid campaigns = $50,000
  Ad spend = $10,000
  ROAS = 5.0x (or 500%)

Benchmark: > 3x is generally profitable (varies by margin)
```

### Real-World ROAS Benchmarks by Channel (Directional)

No single authoritative benchmark exists for any of these numbers. Actual ROAS varies enormously by vertical, margin, and account maturity, and published third-party reports disagree with each other by wide margins. Use these only as a rough starting point for planning conversations, not as a number to promise a customer.

| Channel | Low | Directional Average | Good |
|---------|-----|---------------------|------|
| Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ecommerce | roughly 1.0-1.5x | roughly 1.5-3x | 4x+ |
| Google Shopping | roughly 2-3x | roughly 3-5x | 6x+ |
| Google Search | roughly 3-4x | roughly 4-6x | 8x+ |
| TikTok (ecommerce) | roughly 1.0-1.5x | roughly 1.5-2.5x | 4x+ |
| LinkedIn (SaaS lead gen, CPL not ROAS) | high hundreds $ | roughly $80-200 | under $80 |

**ROAS caveat:** ROAS is a last-click metric by default. True incrementality (measured via holdout testing or media mix modeling) is typically 20-40% lower than platform-reported ROAS. A 3x reported ROAS may be 2.0-2.5x true incremental ROAS. When making budget decisions, pressure-test ROAS claims with incrementality tests.

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

```
NRR = (Start MRR + Expansion MRR - Contraction MRR - Churned MRR) / Start MRR × 100%

Example:
  Start MRR = $100,000
  Expansion = $15,000
  Contraction = $5,000
  Churn = $3,000
  NRR = ($100,000 + $15,000 - $5,000 - $3,000) / $100,000 = 107%

Benchmark: > 100% means customers are growing. > 120% is world-class.
```

### Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)

```
GRR = (Start MRR - Contraction MRR - Churned MRR) / Start MRR × 100%

Example:
  Start MRR = $100,000
  Contraction = $5,000
  Churn = $3,000
  GRR = ($100,000 - $5,000 - $3,000) / $100,000 = 92%

Note: GRR can never exceed 100% (no expansion included).
Benchmark: > 90% is good. > 95% is excellent.
```

### CAC Payback Period

```
Payback Period (months) = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)

Example:
  CAC = $1,200
  ARPU = $100/month
  Gross Margin = 80%
  Payback = $1,200 / ($100 × 0.80) = 15 months

Benchmark: < 12 months (good), < 18 months (acceptable), > 24 months (concerning)
```

## Cohort Analysis Methodology

### Cohort Definition

A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic within a defined time period.

| Cohort Type | Grouping | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Acquisition cohort** | Month/week of first purchase or signup | Retention analysis, LTV trends |
| **Behavioral cohort** | First action type (e.g., "used feature X in first week") | Activation and feature impact analysis |
| **Channel cohort** | Acquisition channel (organic, paid, referral) | Channel quality comparison |
| **Plan cohort** | Starting plan type (free, starter, pro) | Plan-level retention and expansion |

### Cohort Retention Matrix

```
         Month 0    Month 1    Month 2    Month 3    Month 4    Month 5
Jan      100%       85%        72%        65%        60%        58%
Feb      100%       82%        70%        63%        58%
Mar      100%       88%        76%        68%
Apr      100%       84%        73%
May      100%       86%
Jun      100%
```

**Reading the matrix:**
- Each row is a monthly cohort
- Values show % of original cohort still active at each subsequent month
- Diagonal comparison reveals whether product improvements are working (later cohorts should retain better)
- Flat curves at month 3+ indicate product-market fit

### Cohort Analysis Best Practices

- Always normalize to 100% at Month 0
- Compare absolute numbers alongside percentages (a 90% retention of 10 users is less meaningful than 70% of 10,000)
- Look for inflection points (where the curve flattens = natural retention floor)
- Segment cohorts by acquisition channel, plan, and persona for deeper insights

## Attribution Models

### First-Touch Attribution

Gives 100% credit to the first interaction that brought the customer.

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Simple to implement | Ignores all nurturing and conversion touchpoints |
| Shows which channels drive awareness | Overvalues top-of-funnel |
| Good for understanding demand generation | Undervalues bottom-of-funnel |

### Last-Touch Attribution

Gives 100% credit to the last interaction before conversion.

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Simple to implement | Ignores all awareness and nurturing touchpoints |
| Shows which channels close deals | Overvalues bottom-of-funnel |
| Good for understanding conversion drivers | Undervalues top-of-funnel |

### Linear Attribution

Distributes credit equally across all touchpoints.

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Fair representation of all touchpoints | Assumes all touchpoints are equally important |
| Easy to understand | Does not reflect actual influence |
| Good baseline model | Can dilute high-impact touchpoints |

### Time-Decay Attribution

Gives more credit to touchpoints closer to conversion. Typically uses a 7-day half-life.

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Reflects recency bias in purchasing decisions | May undervalue awareness touchpoints |
| More nuanced than first/last touch | Half-life parameter is arbitrary |
| Good for short sales cycles | Complex to explain |

### Position-Based (U-Shaped) Attribution

40% to first touch, 40% to last touch, 20% distributed among middle touches.

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| Values both awareness and conversion | Middle touchpoints are underweighted |
| Balanced view of the funnel | Arbitrary weight distribution |
| Most popular multi-touch model | Does not adapt to actual influence |

### Model Selection Guide

| Sales Cycle | Recommended Model |
|-------------|------------------|
| < 7 days | Last-touch or time-decay |
| 7-30 days | Time-decay or position-based |
| 30-90 days | Position-based or linear |
| > 90 days | Position-based with custom weights |

## Alert Thresholds for Anomaly Detection

### Red Alerts (Immediate Action Required)

| Metric | Threshold | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Churn rate | > 5% monthly | Significant customer loss; investigate root cause |
| Conversion rate drop | > 20% week-over-week | Something is broken, check funnel, site, pricing |
| Error rate | > 1% | Product or infrastructure issue |
| NPS | < 0 | More detractors than promoters |
| Bounce rate | > 80% on key pages | Page content or targeting mismatch |
| CAC | > LTV | Spending more to acquire than customers are worth |
| Pipeline coverage | < 2x | Unlikely to hit target |

### Yellow Alerts (Monitor Closely)

| Metric | Threshold | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Churn rate | 3-5% monthly | Elevated but manageable |
| Trial conversion decline | > 10% week-over-week | Trending down, investigate before it worsens |

| NRR | < 100% | Customers are shrinking |
| Support ticket volume | > 25% increase week-over-week | Possible product issue or onboarding problem |
| Email deliverability | < 95% | Domain reputation may be declining |
| CAC payback | > 18 months | Unit economics getting tight |

### Anomaly Detection Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Z-score** | Flag values > 2 standard deviations from the rolling 30-day mean |
| **Percentage change** | Flag week-over-week or month-over-month changes exceeding threshold |
| **Moving average crossover** | Alert when 7-day MA crosses below 30-day MA |
| **Absolute threshold** | Alert when metric crosses a hard-coded boundary |
| **Forecast deviation** | Alert when actual differs from predicted by > N% |
