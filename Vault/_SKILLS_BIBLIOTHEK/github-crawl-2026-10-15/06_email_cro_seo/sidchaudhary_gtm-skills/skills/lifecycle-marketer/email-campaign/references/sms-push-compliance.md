## SMS Character Limits

### Encoding and Segments

| Encoding | Characters per Segment | Characters per Concatenated Segment | When Used |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| GSM-7 | 160 | 153 (7 chars reserved for UDH header) | Standard Latin characters, digits, common symbols |
| Unicode (UCS-2) | 70 | 67 (3 chars reserved for UDH header) | Emojis, CJK characters, accented characters, special symbols |

### GSM-7 Character Set

Includes: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and these symbols: `@ $ ! " # % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? _ space newline`

**Extended GSM-7 characters** (count as 2 characters each): `{ } [ ] ~ \ ^ | €`

### Segment Counting

| Total Characters (GSM-7) | Segments | Cost Multiplier |
|--------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1-160 | 1 | 1x |
| 161-306 | 2 | 2x |
| 307-459 | 3 | 3x |
| 460-612 | 4 | 4x |

| Total Characters (Unicode) | Segments | Cost Multiplier |
|---------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1-70 | 1 | 1x |
| 71-134 | 2 | 2x |
| 135-201 | 3 | 3x |
| 202-268 | 4 | 4x |

**Rule of thumb:** Keep SMS to 1 segment whenever possible. A single emoji switches the entire message to Unicode encoding, dramatically reducing character budget.

### URL Shortening

- Shortened URLs (~25 chars) save space vs. full URLs (~60-100 chars)
- Use branded short domains for trust and click-through rates
- Always include UTM parameters for attribution

## Timing Best Practices

### SMS Optimal Send Times

| Time Window | Rating | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (local) | Best | People are settled into their day, checking phones |
| 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM (local) | Good | End of workday, commute time, checking personal messages |
| 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM (local) | Moderate | Lunch break, mixed engagement |
| 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM (local) | Moderate | Morning routine, may be seen but not acted on |
| 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM (local) | Low | Evening wind-down, lower intent |
| 9:00 PM - 8:00 AM (local) | Prohibited | Quiet hours, do not send |

### Push Notification Optimal Times

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| User activity window | Send during the user's historically active hours (best approach) |
| Morning digest | 8:00-9:00 AM local for daily summaries |
| Real-time triggers | Immediately on event (e.g., price drop, shipment update) |
| Engagement peak | Align with known product usage peaks |

**Day of week:**
- B2C: Tuesday through Thursday perform best. Weekends work for e-commerce.
- B2B: Tuesday through Thursday during business hours. Avoid Friday afternoon and weekends.

## Deep Link Structure for Push

### URL Scheme Deep Links

```
Format: scheme://path?params

Examples:
  myapp://product/12345
  myapp://cart
  myapp://settings/notifications
  myapp://promo?code=SAVE20&source=push
```

### Universal Links (iOS) / App Links (Android)

```
Format: https://domain.com/path

Examples:
  https://app.example.com/product/12345
  https://app.example.com/checkout
```

### Fallback URL

Always provide a fallback URL for users who:
- Do not have the app installed
- Click the notification on a device without the app
- Have an outdated app version that does not support the deep link

```json
{
  "deepLink": "myapp://product/12345",
  "fallbackUrl": "https://www.example.com/product/12345"
}
```

## Rich Push Notifications

### Images

| Platform | Aspect Ratio | Max Size | Format |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| iOS | 1:1 (square) recommended | 10MB | JPEG, PNG, GIF |
| Android | 2:1 (landscape) required | 1MB | JPEG, PNG |
| Web (Chrome) | 1.5:1 recommended | 1MB | JPEG, PNG |

### Action Buttons

| Platform | Max Buttons | Button Types |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| iOS | 4 | Text labels, can open app/URL/dismiss |
| Android | 3 | Text labels with icons, can open app/URL/reply inline |
| Web | 2 | Text labels, open URL |

**Button best practices:**
- Keep labels short: 1-3 words ("Shop Now", "View", "Dismiss")
- Order by importance: most important action first (leftmost)
- Always include a non-commitment option (e.g., "Later", "Dismiss") to reduce permission revokes

## SMS and Push Performance, Directional Ranges

SMS and push platforms each publish their own performance reports, but sample composition, industry mix, and definitions of "conversion" differ enough between them that no single number is authoritative across senders. Use the ranges below to sanity-check your own numbers, not as a figure to promise a customer.

### SMS Performance (Directional)

| Metric | Typical Range | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| SMS open rate | 90%+ | One of the more consistent figures across sources, SMS gets read far more than email |
| SMS CTR, one-off campaigns | Mid single digits to low teens percent | Varies heavily by list quality and offer |
| SMS CTR, triggered automations | Noticeably higher than campaigns | Behavior-triggered sends consistently beat scheduled broadcasts, the exact multiple varies a lot and isn't stable enough to quote |
| SMS click-to-purchase rate (short window) | Low tens of percent | Wide range by vertical and cart value |
| Healthy opt-out rate | Well under 1% per send | Rising opt-outs signal a frequency or targeting problem |
| Revenue per SMS sent | Sub-dollar, varies by average order value | Not a stable cross-industry figure |

**Directional pattern, not a guaranteed lift:** triggered SMS automations reliably beat scheduled campaign blasts on click rate in every report we reviewed. Don't quote a specific percentage lift as fact, there's no single authoritative source for it.

### Push Notification Performance (Directional)

| Metric | Typical Range | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Opt-in rate, iOS | Roughly 20-55%, highly context-dependent | iOS requires an explicit permission prompt, so opt-in is never automatic |
| Opt-in rate, Android | Roughly 30-90%, highly context-dependent and trending down | Newer Android versions have moved closer to iOS's model, so older "Android auto-opts-in" figures are dated |
| Open/CTR, mobile app push | Low single digits to high single digits percent | |
| Open/CTR, web push | Low single digits percent | |
| Personalized push vs. generic push | Personalized consistently outperforms | Exact multiplier isn't stable enough to quote as a fixed figure |
| Triggered (behavioral) push vs. broadcast push | Triggered consistently outperforms | Same caveat, directional only |

**Push opt-in reality:** iOS requires an explicit permission prompt, so opt-in rates depend heavily on app category and how the prompt is framed. Android's opt-in behavior has shifted with recent OS versions and is no longer reliably near-automatic. How and when you show the permission prompt matters enormously, apps that pre-condition users with a "why" before the system prompt tend to see meaningfully higher opt-in.

### SMS vs. Push vs. Email: Channel Comparison

| Channel | Open/CTR | CVR | Cost | Best For |
|---------|---------|-----|------|----------|
| Email | 2-4% CTR | 0.5-3% | Very low ($0.001-0.005/send) | Nurture, education, long-form content |
| SMS | 7-9% CTR | 5-10% | Medium ($0.01-0.05/send) | Urgency, time-sensitive offers, transactional |
| Push (app) | 4-6% CTR | 2-5% | Very low ($0.001/send) | Real-time triggers, re-engagement, updates |
| Push (web) | 2-4% CTR | 1-3% | Free | Lightweight retargeting, cart recovery |

## Frequency Capping

### SMS Frequency Limits

| Category | Recommended Max | Hard Limit |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Marketing/promotional | 4 per month | 6 per month |
| Transactional | No cap (event-driven) | No cap |
| Re-engagement | 1 per 30 days | 2 per 30 days |

### Push Notification Frequency Limits

| Category | Recommended Max | Hard Limit |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Marketing/promotional | 3 per week | 5 per week |
| Transactional | No cap (event-driven) | No cap |
| Content/engagement | 1 per day | 2 per day |
| Re-engagement | 2 per week | 3 per week |

### Cross-Channel Coordination

- Never send SMS and push about the same topic within 2 hours
- If user engages with push, suppress the SMS follow-up (and vice versa)
- Track total cross-channel touches: max 10 per week across all channels
- Transactional messages do not count toward marketing caps

## Carrier Gates: Registration and Filtering

Legal consent is necessary and not sufficient. In several markets, notably the US, carriers apply
their own registration and content filtering on top of the law. A campaign can be fully
TCPA-compliant and still never arrive.

### Registration is a precondition, not paperwork

US application-to-person messaging requires the sending brand and each campaign to be registered
before traffic flows. Unregistered or misregistered traffic is throttled, surcharged, or blocked
outright, and the block is silent from the sender's side.

| Route | What registration involves | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **10DLC** | Register the brand, then each use case, with sample message copy and the opt-in flow | The standard route. Throughput and daily limits are tied to a trust score. |
| **Toll-free** | Verification submission with the same evidence | Unverified toll-free traffic is heavily filtered. |
| **Short code** | Full provisioning, longest lead time, highest cost | For sustained high volume. |

Consequences the spec must account for:

- **Sample copy is submitted and enforced.** Messages that drift materially from what was
  registered can be filtered. If a campaign's content changes shape, the registration needs
  revisiting.
- **Throughput is capped** by trust tier, so a large send is a scheduling problem, not just a
  content one.
- **Lead time is real.** Registration takes days to weeks. A launch date that assumes instant
  sending is wrong, and this is the most common SMS launch failure.

Before specifying any US SMS campaign, ask which route is registered and whether this use case is
covered. If it is not, say the campaign is blocked on registration and give the lead time, rather
than delivering copy that cannot legally or practically send.

### Content filtering is separate from consent

Carriers filter on message content regardless of how clean the consent is. Common triggers:

- **Public URL shorteners.** Shared shortener domains (bit.ly and similar) carry other senders'
  reputation and are widely filtered. Use a branded or dedicated link domain.
- **Regulated categories**, lending and debt, cannabis, gambling, firearms, adult content,
  high-risk supplements. Some are prohibited outright on standard routes.
- **All-caps words, excess punctuation, and money symbols** in patterns that resemble spam.
- **Bare URLs with no context**, or a link as the entire message body.
- **Sender inconsistency**: rotating numbers for the same programme reads as evasion.

Filtering usually returns a success status to the sender, so **a delivery report is not proof of
arrival.** Where deliverability matters, require real delivery receipts and treat a gap between
sent and delivered as filtering rather than churn.

### Proving consent, not just collecting it

The STOP and HELP handling elsewhere in this file covers the exit path. The entry path has to be
provable, because in a dispute the burden sits with the sender.

Retain, per subscriber: the timestamp, the source (which form, page, or keyword), the exact
disclosure text shown at opt-in, and the channel scope consented to. Rules that follow from this:

- **Consent is per channel and per purpose.** An email subscriber has not consented to SMS, and a
  transactional opt-in is not a marketing opt-in.
- **Keep the disclosure wording as it was shown**, not the current version. What matters is what
  that person actually saw on that date.
- **Retain the record after opt-out**, since the claim usually arrives later.
- **Consent does not transfer.** Not through an acquisition, a list purchase, or a partner
  co-registration, unless the original disclosure covered exactly that.

If the user cannot produce this for a segment, that segment is not sendable. Say so plainly.
