## Node Types

### Trigger

The entry point of a journey. Defines who enters and when.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | `"trigger"` | Fixed |
| `filterDsl` | Object | Filter DSL using `$or`, `$and`, `$not`, `$event`, `$userAttribute` operators |
| `recurring` | Boolean | Whether users can re-enter the journey (default: false) |
| `entryLimit` | Number | Max users who can enter (null = unlimited) |
| `schedule` | Object | Optional cron-based schedule for batch entry evaluation |

**Filter DSL Structure:**
```json
{
  "$and": [
    { "$event": { "name": "page_viewed", "property": "url", "operator": "contains", "value": "/pricing" } },
    { "$userAttribute": { "name": "lifecycle_stage", "operator": "=", "value": "Promising" } }
  ]
}
```

**Operators in Filter DSL:**
- `$or`, Any child condition matches
- `$and`, All child conditions match
- `$not`, Negates the child condition
- `$event`, Matches on event name + property + operator + value
- `$userAttribute`, Matches on user attribute + operator + value

### Delay

Pauses the journey for a specified duration before proceeding to the next node.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | `"delay"` | Fixed |
| `duration` | String | Wait period in shorthand: `"3d"`, `"2h"`, `"30m"`, `"1d12h"` |
| `businessHoursOnly` | Boolean | If true, only counts business hours (9am-5pm Mon-Fri) |

**Duration format:**
- `d` = days
- `h` = hours
- `m` = minutes
- Combinations allowed: `"1d12h30m"` = 1 day, 12 hours, 30 minutes

### Wait-Until

Pauses the journey until a specific event occurs or a timeout is reached.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | `"wait_until"` | Fixed |
| `eventFilter` | Object | Filter DSL defining the awaited event |
| `timeout` | String | Maximum wait duration (e.g., `"7d"`). After timeout, proceeds via the negative path. |

**Behavior:**
- If the event matches before timeout: proceeds via **positive** output
- If timeout expires without event: proceeds via **negative** output
- Useful for: "wait for purchase within 3 days, otherwise send reminder"

### Email

| `optOutMessage` | String | Appended opt-out text (e.g., "Reply STOP to unsubscribe") |
| `mediaUrl` | String | Optional MMS image URL |

**Compliance:** Every SMS must include opt-out instructions. The `optOutMessage` is automatically appended if not present in the body. Character count includes the opt-out text.

### Push

Sends a push notification (iOS, Android, Web).

| Field | Type | Description |

### Condition

Binary branch node. Evaluates a filter DSL condition and routes to positive (true) or negative (false) children.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|

| `filterDsl` | Object | Filter DSL to evaluate against the current person |
| `positiveNodeId` | String | Node to execute if condition is true |
| `negativeNodeId` | String | Node to execute if condition is false |

**Children connect via `inputPath`:**
- `inputPath: "positive"`, the true branch
- `inputPath: "negative"`, the false branch

### Multi-Split

N-way branch node. Evaluates multiple conditions in priority order.

## Node Linking

Nodes are linked using three properties on each node:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `previousId` | Number | 0-based index of the parent node in the journey's node array |
| `inputType` | String | `"default"` for standard flow |
| `inputPath` | String | `"default"`, `"positive"`, or `"negative"`, determines which output of the parent this node connects to |

**Linking rules:**
- The trigger node has no `previousId` (it is the root)
- Linear sequences use `inputPath: "default"`
- Condition nodes produce two outputs: children specify `inputPath: "positive"` or `inputPath: "negative"`
- Multi-split nodes produce N+1 outputs: branch children reference by branch index, default child uses `inputPath: "default"`
- Loop children reference the loop node and execute per iteration

## Channel Guardrails

Guardrails are per-channel thresholds that automatically pause journey steps or entire journeys when breached.

### Email Guardrails

| Metric | Warning | Pause | Action |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Bounce rate | > 0.3% | > 0.5% | Pause email step, review list |
| Complaint rate | > 0.03% | > 0.05% | Pause email step immediately |
| Unsubscribe rate | > 0.3% | > 0.5% | Pause email step, review content |

### SMS Guardrails

| Metric | Warning | Pause | Action |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Opt-out rate | > 0.15% | > 0.2% | Pause SMS step |
| Carrier rejection | > 0.5% | > 1.0% | Pause SMS step, review content |
| Delivery failure | > 3% | > 5% | Pause SMS step, review list |

### Push Guardrails

| Metric | Warning | Pause | Action |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Permission revoke rate | > 0.15% | > 0.2% | Pause push step |
| Token error rate | > 1% | > 2% | Pause push step, refresh tokens |

---

## Holdout Controls

Each journey step can have an optional holdout, a percentage of users who reach that step but do not receive the treatment.

| Parameter | Range | Default |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Per-step holdout percentage | 0-50% | 0% (no holdout) |
| Holdout assignment | Hash-based, deterministic per user per step | -- |

**Purpose:** Measures the incremental impact of individual journey steps. Users in the holdout proceed through the journey but skip the treatment (e.g., email is not sent), allowing comparison of downstream behavior.

**Analysis:** Compare conversion/engagement rates of holdout vs. treated users at each step to quantify incremental lift.

---

## Step Risk Classification

Each node type carries a risk classification that determines approval requirements and monitoring intensity.

| Risk Level | Node Types | Monitoring | Approval |
|------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Low** | Update Attribute, Delay, Wait-Until, Condition, Multi-Split, Loop | Standard logging | None required |
| **Medium** | Email, SMS, Push, Run Workflow | Guardrail monitoring, rate limiting | Optional review |
| **High** | Webhook | Full request/response logging, circuit breaker, alerting | Recommended review |

---

## Cross-Channel Timing

### Minimum Gap Between Channels

To avoid overwhelming users with messages across multiple channels in rapid succession:

| Channel Pair | Minimum Gap |
|-------------|-------------|
| Email → SMS | 4 hours |
| Email → Push | 2 hours |
| SMS → Email | 4 hours |
| SMS → Push | 2 hours |
| Push → Email | 1 hour |
| Push → SMS | 2 hours |
| Same channel → Same channel | 24 hours (configurable) |

### Frequency Capping Rules

Global frequency caps that apply across all journeys for a given person:

| Channel | Default Cap | Period | Override |
|---------|------------|--------|----------|
| Email | 5 messages | Per week | Configurable 1-14 per week |
| SMS | 4 messages | Per month | Configurable 1-8 per month |
| Push | 3 messages | Per week | Configurable 1-7 per week |
| All channels combined | 10 messages | Per week | Configurable |

**Cap behavior:** When a cap is reached, the message is suppressed (not delayed). The journey continues but the send step is skipped with a "frequency_capped" status.

**Priority override:** Messages marked as "transactional" (e.g., password reset, order confirmation) bypass frequency caps. Only marketing/engagement messages are capped.

## What Flows Are Actually Worth

Flows are where lifecycle revenue concentrates, and the concentration is extreme enough to change
priorities.

| Measure | Benchmark |
|---|---|
| Email and SMS share of total revenue | ~38-45% (P90) |
| Flow share of email revenue | ~58-65% |
| Automated email share of email-generated sales | **~37%, from ~2% of send volume** |

That last row is the argument for building flows before campaigns: **2% of volume produces 37% of
sales.** A team choosing between another campaign and fixing a flow is choosing between the 98% and the
2%.

### Per-flow benchmarks

| Flow | Benchmark |
|---|---|
| Abandoned cart | Highest revenue per recipient of any automation, ~$3.65. Recovery 8-12% (P90) |
| Welcome | 12-18% conversion (P90), ~91% open rate |

**The single most consequential design finding:** a **single-email** cart abandonment flow recovers
about **2-3%**, while a **multi-step flow combining email and SMS** recovers **8-12%**. That is a three
to four times difference produced by adding steps and a second channel, not by better copy.

So when auditing or designing a recovery flow, **step count and channel mix are the first questions**,
ahead of subject lines and timing. A one-email flow is not a weak version of a good flow, it is a
different and much worse thing. Where a flow exists but underperforms, check its step count before
rewriting anything.

The welcome flow's ~91% open rate has a second implication: it is the highest-attention moment the
brand will ever get with that contact, which makes it the wrong place for a generic greeting and the
right place for the single most important thing the brand needs them to understand.
